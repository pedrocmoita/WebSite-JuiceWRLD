            <p>Jarad Anthony Higgins, a.k.a. Juice Wrld, was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter.
                Higgins began his career as an independent artist in 2015 and signed a recording contract with Grade A Productions later on. He gained recognition with his 2018 <span class="bottom-border">single "Lucid 
                Dreams"</span>, which peaked at <span class="red-accent">number two</span> on the <span class="bottom-border">US Billboard Hot 100</span>. It was included on his <span class="red-accent">triple platinum</span> debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), alongside the singles 
                "All Girls Are the Same", "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the <span class="red-accent">Hot 100</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>Higgins had a <span class="bottom-border">history of drug abuse</span> that began at an early age, and he spoke openly about his experiences. His mother claimed that he was also dealing with anxiety and depression
                on top of his <span class="red-accent">battle</span> with <span class="red-accent">drug addiction</span>. Higgins had agreed to attend drug rehabilitation weeks prior to his <span class="red-accent">death</span>. 
                <span class="bottom-border">On December 8, 2019</span>, Higgins was aboard a private jet flying from Los Angeles to Chicago. Law enforcement officers were waiting for the jet to arrive, having been notified by federal
                agents, while the flight was in route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. <span class="red-accent">Juice died </span>that night following a <span class="bottom-border">drug overdose</span>.
